The Archeville Super-Archy Tournament
The Archeville super-archy tournament is a team archery tournament that happens once every
four years. Every nation sends two of their best archers to the tournament, and the first team to
reach 60 points wins.
● The archery board has 5 concentric circles - A, B, C, D and E, A being the innermost. A
carries 5 points and E carries 1 point.
● Points for every circle increase by 1 at every round. For example, In the 4th round, A will
carry 8 points while E will carry 4 points. Hitting outside the board (F) will always be 0.
● If both archers in a team hit the same circle in a round, a bonus 2 points are given to the
team for synchronicity.
● The game finishes when one team reaches 60 points.
● If more than one team cross 60 points in a round, the team with the highest score wins.
